<i class="bold">Avant de faire mon premier pas hors de la grotte, <br>
où mon ignorance sera révélée par le soleil,<br>
même à ce moment-là,<br>
je les sens se moquer de moi.</i><sup>1</sup><br><br>
I find myself in front of the market<br>
Beckoned by the sweet succulence of pears<br>
And though I long to soothe indulgence<br>
I am frozen in a desolate arboretum<br>
Here, alone, I have wandered gilded paths<br>
Hearing only the faint songs of lark and nightingale<br>
Till now, as I am paralyzed<br>
By the gaze<br><br>
Though not bare of body<br>
I feverishly harbour a naked soul<br>
The tenth law, once motion’s source<br>
Now binds me<br>
And though the bleats ring out<br>
Echoing through skull, fat, and flesh<br>
The other commands them:<br>
Go home unfed<br><br>
Watchful eyes would have me believe<br>
That this petrified project<br>
A behavior as old as Pluto’s estate<br>
Is kin with its creator<br>
That it must seem as vibrant<br>
As the posies cast upon the tombs of giants<br>
That its form commands its nature<br><br>
I know only that this is deceit<br>
This claim, perjurious to the audience of humanity<br>
Is as toxic as its orator<br>
The children of change know this truth well<br>
That mothers alone are benevolent<br>
That their basic element is beauty<br>
So I awoke, thawed<br><br>
The dream, as it often is, already lost<br>
But the din of the komos still echoing<br>
As fluid passed the threshold<br>
I knew I had drunk<br>
Horns already forming, I raised in eminence<br>
Orpheus, under the influence<br><br>
</p>

<i class="bold">
Ibi emergit horrendum, ambitiosus, <br>
sed insuperabilis veritatem,<br>
revelata per umbras in pariete:<br>
ego autem non vis, aliis intelligere. <sup>2</sup><br><br>
</i>
Behold<br>
That which is beauty and light<br>
Rage and anger<br>
Alteration and consummation<br>
But most primary and sovereign<br>
Look upon the impenetrable veil<br><br>
Understand:<br>
When he realizes that without him,<br>
The flock would perish<br>
Only then does Pan know power<br>
Does it not seem<br>
Their anxious cries<br>
Make for garish harmony after all?<br>
<br>
It matters not<br>
I am as deaf to them<br>
As they are blind to me<br>
<br>
In the comfort of night I began a hibernation<br>
Tearing leaves turned too early<br>
Tepid from sun and wet from dew<br>
In secret, I dove under<br>
Like a thief<br>
Reemerging onto that perfect edge<br>
Scorning the generosity of Prometheus<br>
Blazing alone into the abyss
<br><br><br><br>
My figure, seared to the chasm floor<br>
Macabre and forbidden<br>
I toil to muster the cosmic pieces<br>
Like sweet August does a marriage<br>
Of the summer and autumn<br>
Yet, as they collect, the light becomes devastating<br>
And sick with parsimony<br>
My wings melt away<br><br>
So I awoke, chained<br>
My past not even a memory
The taste of a selfish fruit still lingering<br>
And I wept for a stasis once known by the fauna<br>
Mechanized shell<br>
I stumble across the burning lake<br>
</p>

Στο τελικό βήμα, τα όρια υλικού διαγράφονται.<br>
Αυτό που τον τιμωρούσε αρχικά,<br>
τότε δηλητηρίασε.<br>
έδωσε τη θέση του σε μια χαοτική αλήθεια. <sup>3</sup><br><br>
</i>
At the peak of a glade<br>
In mourning<br>
A drop hit my forehead<br>
And I, without tongue, watched<br>
as Augustine’s tears crossed my visage<br>
<br>
As I tell of this now, I sit with sheared beasts<br>
Content only to let them pass as is pleasing<br>
Agency is their capital<br>
And given enough time<br>
We will lead each other to flaming pastures<br><br>
There, I will kneel<br>
Fixed to be consumed by a goddess<br>
Whose name I do not know<br>
But who appears terribly gorgeous<br>
In whirling entropy<br>
Punishing only those who resist her grasp<br>
<br>
Now, when I look in peoples’ faces<br>
I see the age they will become<br>
And when they don ornate feathers<br>
And breath fresh yield into my being<br>
My cellar comes alight and banishes the rot<br>
<br>
A great banquet is in order<br>
There is much to be done<br>
The hall will be lined with desecrated couches<br>
Yet none are invited<br>
The muses will come and go, swallowing my creation<br>
And in their absence I will be<br>
A contented Cronos<br>
See me emit charred tone<br>
Vaporizing qualm and illusion<br>
I am pregnant with a creature of the arras<br>
And there is still a long path to tread<br>
Caution, clandestine shelter still tempts he<br>
Who foolishly believes in mastery<br>
<br>
I know the end is binding<br>
I only hope<br>
Before I am dreadfully judged<br>
That, grinding bone to silt<br>
Crumpling under the weight of my wares<br>
I will still feel heat on my brow<br>
And peering over the horizon<br>
I find myself in front of the market<br>

today I am struck with memories of tender moments from<br>
solid people. they leave me wanting a reunion, no, not like<br>
the last one, one more meaningful moment, one more<br>
tender touch on a place I have not touched before, a<br>
familiar touch, no let’s call it what it is, a kiss, let’s do it<br>
again, I know we did it last time but there’s room for<br>
improvement, I’ll erase the memory of the last one from<br>
my head. an understanding, so scarcely given, a messy<br>
moment in a tidy room. when I told you about the<br>
psychology of touch, the somatosensory system and such,<br>
how there is a reason to why we enjoy holding hands, lips<br>
kissing lips, I throw a query, isn’t it weird, how us,<br>
humans, like doing that, would you like to do it with me,<br>
debunking the myth of our synastry. and you caught it,<br>
with a statement, a thesis if you will but with less intent,<br>
so a hypothesis, those you like, so; ever since you said,<br>
“I must have a bigger part for my neck in my sensory<br>
cortex because I get so ticklish there,” <br><br>
I could not stop, thinking<br><br>
about kissing your neck.

<p class="emptyvessel">The thought of her sparked joy and a sense of obsession,<br>
Leaving her surroundings purely enamoured,<br>
Perfection.<br><br>
In my mind, she was all sorts of things.<br>
Scented with the evocative perfume my mother would wear,<br>
and would sometimes spray onto me as a child, ensnared.<br>
Unconquered curls cascading down her spine,<br>
with her coiffed baby hairs sitting daintily on her forehead,<br>
not daring to waiver from the silhouette of her disguise.<br><br>
Hazel brown eyes,<br>
stealing the glow from luminaries nearby,<br>
with flickers of rebellion and desire,<br>
just enough to captivate wandering eyes.<br><br>
She reminded me of primary colours. Loud, clear, bold.<br>
Thieving the other amalgamations of their worth.<br><br>
My mind ventured into the endless perfect possibilities,<br>
But soon I realised my gullibility.<br><br>
The vessel filled until it could no longer,<br>
Puking out the sins that made it stronger.<br>
My creature of enigma was just another,<br>
Empty, but still, leaving me to wonder.

<br><br>
<div class="overflow-auto" style="height:1000px;">
<p class="zeina">
My mother took off her rings when she slept. They were there in a precarious little pile
when I went to wake her during those endless drowsy afternoons, a stack of silver always at my
eye level. The light was turning blue but her face was still illuminated slightly; I couldn’t see her
breathe but I could see the red blush of sleep on her cheeks. I knew if I woke her up she would
roll over and look at me through half-closed eyes, maybe ask what I wanted, but I could never
find it in myself to wake her. She stayed rosy and removed in her sleep and I would leave as
quietly as I came, as quietly as I could.<br>
I only remember her taking off her rings regularly on two occasions: to sleep and to
shower. She kept them on at all other times, even when she washed her hands, and when I was a
child and even now I thought those rings must have been some of the cleanest that little porcelain
sink had ever seen.<br>
And she had some of the cleanest hands I had ever seen, although at that point in my
childhood I hadn’t seen very many. I had always thought they would be beautiful without the
rings, but with them they were something else: when she stretched out her fingers her palm was
almost too arched, and the dull silver caught the light in a way I have yet to recreate, as hard as I
try. Since those years of watching her as she slept, waiting to wake her, I’ve looked through high
end stores and flea markets to find rings like those of my mother, but they never quite gleam
enough.<br>
Everything is brighter in memory; I’ve always liked the way silver catches the light.
Those rings were a part of her, a continuation of her knuckle, a necessary bump when I
grabbed her hand in the dark. Their cool, smooth texture was reassuring when she touched my
forehead to feel for a fever, and I loved to hear the way they clicked when she tapped her fingers
on the table as she thought. They were beautiful and rare - I didn’t realize until later, when I
started looking for ones similar - but she always let me try them on, whenever I asked, as often
as that was. Of course, they slipped over my round little fingers with plenty of room to spare. But
the weight on my fingers of the silver band and blue-green stone was comforting enough.
In those days she took me with her most places out of necessity. We went to the farmers
market in the summer, me holding her hand and by extension her rings as I watched her shoulder
her way through the crowd holding a bag filled with bread. We went to bookstores in the winter,
me craning my neck back so the braid she always did in my hair fell down my spine as I watched
her choose a book and then put it back. We took the train in all seasons, me dozing in and out of
sleep as she absentmindedly rubbed my shoulder.<br>
She took me with her to most places, and this is how I ended up at the dinner party. One
of her friends from college was hosting, and we lived down the street, and the friend that usually
watched me was going as well. I was hardly old enough to pronounce any of the titles of the
books they talked about, let alone attend - I was normally asleep by the time they poured the
second glass of wine - but my mother took me along anyway.<br>
I watched her get ready, trying on her rings while she sipped tea in between visits to the
closet to try on different dresses. I touched the cover of the newest book she’d acquired at the
dollar bookstore two subway stops and a block away and tried to puzzle out how to say the title.
By the time I had hit the subtitle, she was ready, hair braided down her back like mine and tea
fully sipped and the rings on her fingers, as always, as ever.<br>
I don’t remember the actual event, or what I ate, or the amount of times I fell asleep,
although my mother told me later that it was a little drawn out, that we had some type of greens
and fish but I had only eaten peas, and that I fell asleep many times. I remember there was music
playing, and then there was not. I remember laughter. I remember her taking off her rings.
This hosting friend had a small piano against the wall. My memory of this event abruptly
cuts back in when someone says Sylvie, play something, please, play and I realize that it is my
mother they are talking to, my mother walking up to the piano.<br>
She took her rings off. She sat down to play. I don’t remember what she played, or the
way it sounded, but I remember how I felt: like my eyes were closed while they were open, like I
had walked into the rain without flinching, like the first time I heard birds in the spring.
Years later, after I had found piles of music book in a box in the top of her closet, after I
had begged her to let me take lessons, after I had played some of the pieces in that very box, I
asked her what piece she had played that night of the dinner party.
She smiled, pushed her now-gray hair back behind her, took a ring off her finger and
spun it around. I was old now, and I had rings of my own, but I still couldn’t help but watch the
flash of silver as it rotated around her finger.<br>
And she said that piece wasn’t anything. She said she made it up.<br>

<p class="zeina">
From the grey sea <br>
And the corrosive waves that make up <br>
The Earth's heartbeat,<br>
I rose from my own tragedy.<br>
My body is to be cherished, <br>
Not taken nor beaten - <br>
My mind to be enlightened and sang to from above,<br>
Never once abused or molested.<br>
I climb the fluffy cotton strips<br>
Up out of this world and enter the sky-blue door.<br>
Slowly, ever so, my tongue peaks out from between my lips<br>
And I have a taste.
A slow, upward flick and the internal functioning of the human body<br>
Implodes.<br>
Cosmic Ambien.<br>
A universal overdose.<br>
I open my mouth wider and gorgoe myself on the color, <br>
The light,<br>
The weightlessness,<br>
And loosen my grip on the stratospheric doorframe,<br>
Slipping ever so elegantly into an inter-dimensional embrace<br>
That I dream to meet.<br><br>

The McGill Tribune is proud to present the Winter 2020 Creative Supplement, highlighting excellent creative work by McGill students, including poetry, photography, illustrations, and mixed-media.
We would like to thank the Arts Undergraduate Society Financial Management Committee (AUS FMC) for funding this project, and Chad Ronalds & Hebdo Litho for printing this issue. Moreover, we appreciate all the artists who submitted; it was a pleasure to review your work.
Although McGill doesn’t have a formal visual arts program, students find their own creative outlets. The Creative Supplement serves as a platform to highlight these endeavours. McGill students are notoriously bright and hardworking; we hope this issue proves that they are also immensely talented. <br>
